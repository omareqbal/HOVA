# Auditorium and Room Booking System

## Project Details
When a student needs to book a room or auditorium for some event, he has to take
permission from several parties such as his department, authority, security etc.
It becomes very complicated to handle all the resources required and to obtain the
permissions of the room, for an event. To ease this process for all parties, we
propose a Management System which handles some of the possible scenarios to
streamline the process.  

Room booking in KGP (such as V1, Main-Building) is done for various events by
societies, students and professors etc. . If a student wants to book a room, he must
first obtain compulsory permission from his Department, the Authority that owns the
room and the Security Section. A professor does not need Departmental Verification.
He can also have a specific set of optional requests such as a request for
Water-Service, AV Cell-Service and Permission to construct stalls.  

We intend to provide an interface between the applicants and the concerned
authorities where the applicant can choose a room and slot ( day - time ) based on
availability. Each Application is sent to the concerned authoritiesâ€™ database for
verification/approval. The applicant can also view the status of their approvals at any
instant. We shall also support the cancellation of bookings.  

Our basic aim is to reduce the hassle which applicants need to face each time they
need to book a room.
